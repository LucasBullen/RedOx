## Contributing to Corrosion

### Reporting Issues
Issue reports and feature requests are always appreciated and are made in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/eclipse/corrosion/issues)

### Working on Corrosion

For setting up Corrosion for testing and development follow the [Using Github Installation Instructions](documentation/Installation.md#using-github)

### Making Pull Requests

To keep the commit history clean and navigatable, PR are limited to a single commit. If your PR has multiple commits that all work together, they should be squashed into a single commit. If you believe that the different commits are too unrelated to be squashed together, then they should be put into multiple PRs to allow single feature PRs.

Corrosion is an Eclipse project and all contributors must do the following before having a pull request merged:
 - Sign the Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)
	- Create an Eclipse Account: https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register
	- Sign the ECA: https://www.eclipse.org/contribute/cla
 - Add the Signed-off-by footer to your commits
	- Footer of all commits should contain: `Signed-off-by: @{name} <@{email}>`, see [here for an example commit](https://github.com/eclipse/corrosion/commit/09f4fa5d771bca3de6f4e5454ad324a517fc42bf)
	- Either add manually or use `git commit -s`
