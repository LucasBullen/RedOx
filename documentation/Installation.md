### Using Github
**For contributors and testers, This will allow running the plugin within a child Eclipse to test and develop new features**

 - Download [Eclipse for Eclipse Contributors](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) or any version of Eclipse with the `Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment` package
 - Clone the repo: https://github.com/eclipse/corrosion
 - In the root of the repository, run `mvn clean verify` (You will need [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/))
   - If this does not execute successfully, try running `mvn clean verify -DskipTests` instead (See [Issue #104](https://github.com/eclipse/corrosion/issues/104))

For running Corrosion in a child Eclipse instance:

 - Open the following projects in Eclipse:
   - org.eclipse.corrosion
   - target-platform
   - org.eclipse.corrosion.tests (If you intend on contributing)
 - Ignore the errors, they are about to go away with the next step
 - Set the Target Platform
   - Open the `target-platform/target-platform.target` file with the Target Editor
   - Press the `Refresh` button
   - Wait for the reload to perform
   - In the top right corner, press the `Set as Active Target Platform` button
 - Run the `org.eclipse.corrosion` project as an `Eclipse Application`

For using a local p2 repository:

 - Follow the "Using p2 repository" above
 - Use `/{path_to_repository}/corrosion/repository/target/repository` as the p2 site
